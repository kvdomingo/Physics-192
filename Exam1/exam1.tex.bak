\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:cyl-vs-orig} shows a boxplot of the number of cylinders produced by each car manufacturer. It shows that Car Origin 1 and 3 manufacture a variety of vehicles having 4-- to 8--cylinder engines, while Car Origin 2 only manufactures 4-- to 6--cylinder engines. The plot also shows that all three manufacturers tend to favor production of more cars equipped with 4-- to 6--cylinder engines.

\begin{figure}[tb]

	\label{fig:hp-vs-orig}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hp-vs-orig} shows a boxplot of horsepower (HP) vs the car origin. Car Origins 1 and 2 produce vehicles with roughly the same HP range. Among the data, Car Origin 1 has one outlier just below 250 HP. Car Origin 2, while producing similar HP range as Car Origin 1, has a median below that of the latter. Car Origin 3 produces vehicles with a much tighter range and below that of either Car Origin 1 and 2, while having three outliers above the fourth quartile.

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{box-mpg_vs_orig.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:mpg-vs-orig}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mpg-vs-orig} shows the miles per gallon (MPG) for each car manufacturer. Car Origin 3 produces vehicles with the best fuel economy, as its median is higher than that of either Car Origin 1 and 2. The latter has a more controlled range of fuel economy but also has the most inefficient. Car Origin 1 sits between the other two and has a range of MPG similar to Car Origin 3.

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{box-td_vs_orig.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:td-vs-orig}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:td-vs-orig} shows the turn diameters for each car manufacturer. At first glance, the inverse proportionality is evident. Car Origin 1 produces vehicles with the highest turn diameters, but also has the widest range. Car Origin 2 and 3 produce a roughly similar range, with the former sitting between the other two.

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{box-hp_vs_cyl.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:hp-vs-cyl}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:hp-vs-cyl} shows the HP vs the number of cylinders. As one would expect, more engine cylinders would cause more displacement and subsequently, more horsepower. 

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{box-mpg_vs_cyl.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:mpg-vs-cyl}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mpg-vs-cyl} shows the MPG for each number of cylinders. A 4-cylinder engine shows moderate fuel economy, while a 6-cylinder setup varies more widely. An 8-cylinder engine tends to be consistent in having the worst fuel economy

\begin{figure}[tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{mpg_vs_hp.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig:scatter-mpg-vs-hp}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:scatter-mpg-vs-hp} shows a scatter plot of number of MPG vs HP. The regression line has a Pearson correlation of $-0.755$ and a $p$-value of $< 0.05$, indicating strong correlation between MPG and HP.
